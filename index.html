            <a href="https://sei.cmu.edu/go/er2024" target="_blank"
              >43rd International Conference on Conceptual Modeling (ER 2024)</a

              Law plays a crucial role in almost every aspect of our life, both public and private. Thousands of legal documents are constantly produced by institutional bodies, such as Parliaments and Courts, which constitute a prominent source of information and knowledge for judges, lawyers, and other professionals involved in legal decision-making. To cope with growing volume, complexity, and articulation of legal documents as well as to foster digital justice and digital law, increasing effort is being devoted to digital transformation processes in the legal domain.
            </p>
            <p>
              Conceptual modeling plays a crucial role in this scenario, to formalize features and nature of terminology used in legal documents and to promote the development and the adoption of legal ontologies, shared vocabularies, and open linked data about legislation, case-law, and other relevant legal information. Furthermore, advanced functionalities for legal data and process modeling and management are advocated, embracing modern technologies like Semantic Web, NLP, AI, to enable semantic text search and exploration, legal knowledge extraction and formalization, legal decision-making and legal analytics.
            </p>
            <p>
              This workshop aims to constitute a meeting venue for a variety of researchers involved in digital justice and digital law, originating a rich community crossing different disciplines besides computer science, like law, legal informatics, management, economics and social sciences. The workshop will provide an opportunity to share, discuss, and identify new approaches and solutions for modeling, analysis, formalization, and interpretation of legal data and related processes.
            </p>

              In this edition of JUSMOD, we are going to discuss the topics of computing and law, considering the conference theme in this year, Conceptual Modeling, AI and Beyond. Also, new topics have been added to this edition.
